# SDKGen
Still in an early stage of development. Be patient ;-)

## TODO
- [ ] Allow API versioning
- [ ] Allow property tuning with "properties spec". Somwthing like: "prop1: name=desiredName, type=desiredType"
- [ ] Right now, when a property value is a map, it is converted to a class/struct. Allow it to be generated just as a map/dictionary
- [ ] Allow the specification of query parameters
